# LYHKYLF Fund Policy (v0.4)
This document defines the operating policy for the fund: scope, eligibility, decision rules, measurement, safeguarding, data dignity, publication, and handoff expectations.

---

## 1) Purpose

Seed early-stage, high-learning experiments that expand **youth agency and capabilities** for **low-income youth (7–18) in Singapore**, with a clear pathway to **institutional handoff within ~3 years**.

---

## 2) Target population and eligibility

### 2.1 Geography and age
- **Singapore only**
- **Age:** 7–18 years old (inclusive)

### 2.2 Low-income eligibility (default rule)
A youth is considered eligible if they meet **any** of the following (documented per grant):
- Covered by **most general means-tested schemes** in Singapore (broadly inclusive).
- Recipient of support from **IPC charities** (generally qualifies).
- Lives in **1-room or 2-room flats**.

**Exceptions:** Handled **case-by-case** when needed; grantee must document the rationale and approach.

---

## 3) Program scope

### 3.1 In scope
- **Direct-to-youth delivery only** (youth are the primary participants and beneficiaries during the grant period).
- School-adjacent enrichment (after-school, weekends, holidays) that increases:
  - **Agency:** choice-making, self-efficacy, creative production
  - **Capabilities (priority):** learning, creativity  
  - **Health-functioning:** **case-by-case, low priority** (only when the theory of change is strong; no treatment)
- **High-learning experiments** (high-risk or medium-risk); **no replication-only** funding.

### 3.2 Out of scope (hard exclusions)
- Programs without youth delivery during the grant period (e.g., adult-only training, tool-building/curriculum creation with no youth delivery).
- Policy advocacy and movement-building.
- For-profit entities as primary grantees; individuals (no scholarships/stipends to individuals).
- Regranting/intermediary models.
- **Mental health crisis** work.
- **Medication-adjacent** work.
- Health treatment/clinical services.

---

## 4) Minimum bar (direct-to-youth)

- **Cohort minimum:** ≥ **5 youth**
- **Dosage minimum:** ≥ **15 sessions per year** with the youth
- **One-off holiday camps:** only under **personal discretion**.

---

## 5) Grant parameters

- **Grant size:** SGD **10k–30k per year**
- **Duration:** annual grants, renewable up to ~**3 years**
- **Checkpoints:** Months **6**, **12**, **24** (renew / pivot / stop / graduate)

---

## 6) Outcomes and measurement

### 6.1 Required primaries (locked by Month 6)
By **Month 6**, every grant must define and lock **two primaries**:

1) **Primary Outcome (Trajectory Lever)**  
Choose **one** primary outcome from the fund’s **Trajectory Lever Menu** (6.2), with guardrails in 6.3.

2) **Primary Mechanism Indicator (Proximal)**  
Define **one** mechanism indicator that represents the earliest observable proof that the theory of change is firing (e.g., a short rubric, artifact score, or behavioral proxy).

Programs may start Months 0–6 with exploratory measures, but both primaries must be set by Month 6 for renewal decisions at Months 12 and 24.

### 6.2 Trajectory Lever Menu (choose one as the Primary Outcome)
The fund’s default menu includes:

- **Sustained engagement / persistence** (behavioral/admin)
- **Skill / mastery progression** (domain-specific; ideally anchored in observable progression)
- **Self-regulation / executive function** (behavioral/rubric)
- **Belonging / social connectedness** (often mixed-method; should include a behavioral/admin anchor)
- **Autonomy / choice competence** (rubric + behavioral anchor)
- **Wellbeing / functioning** *(case-by-case; low priority; non-clinical only)*

The fund may refine the menu per thematic cycle.

### 6.3 Guardrails to keep outcomes decision-grade
For the **Primary Outcome (Trajectory Lever)**:

- **Behavioral/admin anchor required:** the primary must be behavioral/admin **or** be anchored to a behavioral/admin proxy (e.g., attendance continuity, practice hours, progression level).
- **Durability definition required:** the primary must specify durability, such as:
  - sustained for **>= 8 weeks**, and/or
  - repeated across **>= 2 cycles/cohorts by Month 24** (or an equivalent repetition standard).
- **Unit + cadence required:** the primary must specify unit of analysis (youth-level internally; **aggregate reporting to the fund**) and measurement cadence.

### 6.4 Acceptable instruments and evidence design
**Instruments allowed** (as appropriate to the lever/mechanism):
- Observed rubrics
- Artifact-based scoring (outputs/portfolios)
- Anonymous, age-appropriate self-report
- External signals (teacher/mentor ratings) where feasible and appropriate
- Behavioral/admin data (attendance, continuity, practice hours, progression)

**Comparison designs (preferred set):**
- **Matched comparison**, and/or
- **Within-cohort stepped rollout**.

Where comparisons are not feasible, grantees must justify and strengthen pre/post + mechanism evidence.

### 6.5 Stage expectations (Month 6 / 12 / 24)
- **Month 6 (baseline + mechanism):**
  - Both primaries locked (Outcome lever + Mechanism indicator)
  - Baseline established
  - Early movement in the mechanism indicator (or a clear plan to detect it by Month 12)

- **Month 12 (benefit signals):**
  - Pre/post movement on the **Primary Outcome**
  - Evidence that mechanism movement plausibly links to the outcome
  - Comparison evidence where feasible

- **Month 24 (durability + repeatability):**
  - Outcome durability achieved per definition
  - Positive signals across **>= 2 cohorts/cycles** where applicable
  - Handoff-ready evidence snapshot aligned to the handoff lane

### 6.6 Minimum required indicators (all grants)
All grants must report:
- Attendance / dosage
- Retention / completion
- Safeguarding incidents and resolution timeliness

### 6.7 Measurement burden and data dignity
- Measurement burden should remain within **~20%** of the grant resources (exceptions require written justification).
- Data collection is minimal; identifiers limited to **name and phone number** for operations.
- Grantees may use participant IDs internally, but the fund receives **aggregate reporting only**.
- Raw data retained up to **12 months after program end**; aggregated data may be retained longer.


## 7) Stage gates and renewal decisions

### 7.1 Decision points
At Months **6**, **12**, **24** the fund decides:
- **Renew** (optionally with conditions)
- **Pivot** (as a renewal condition)
- **Stop**
- **Graduate** (handoff-ready / final-year transition)

### 7.2 Missing data but strong delivery
If delivery is strong but measurement is inadequate, the fund may extend runway **tied to the program’s cycle cadence** to improve measurement.

### 7.3 Flat outcomes but strong delivery
Default action: **Renew with conditions** (tightened hypothesis + redesigned delivery).

### 7.4 Decision memos
- **Charity/grantee writes** Month 6/12/24 learning and results memos.
- **Grant panel reviews** and recommends.
- **Anchor donor decides** (final approval).

---

## 8) Safeguarding

### 8.1 Minimum safeguarding standard
Required at minimum: **Baseline + screening**, with an expectation to move toward **full** standard over time.

- **Baseline (minimum):**
  - Child protection policy
  - Mandatory reporting SOP
  - Incident logging + escalation workflow
  - Staff/volunteer training
- **Screening (minimum):**
  - Background checks for staff/volunteers where applicable
  - Code of conduct
  - Safe supervision practices
- **Aim for full (target standard):**
  - Photography/media consent rules
  - Transport rules
  - Partner venue safety checklist
  - Safe recruitment process
  - Regular refreshers/drills and documentation

### 8.2 Supervision ratios and adequacy review
- Ratios/supervision rules are set by the **grantee’s safeguarding policy**.
- The fund reviews adequacy as part of diligence and renewal.

### 8.3 Outdoor / physical-risk programs (allowed with strict controls)
Outdoor/high-physical-risk programs may be funded **only with strict risk controls**, including:
- Certified instructors (where relevant)
- Appropriate insurance coverage
- Venue/activity risk assessment
- Emergency response plan
- **Explicit parental consent**
- **Transport rules**
- **Minimum supervision standards** (even if exact ratios remain grantee-defined)

### 8.4 Auto-stop rule for high-risk incidents
Stop funding when an **unresolved high-risk incident persists beyond 7 days**.

### 8.5 Mandatory reporting
Mandatory reporting is required.

---

## 9) Data dignity and PDPA

### 9.1 Collection limits
- The fund’s posture is **minimal data collection**.
- **Direct identifiers collected should be limited to name and phone number** for operational purposes.
- No collection of sensitive health/clinical data (consistent with out-of-scope).

### 9.2 Reporting to the fund
- Fund receives **aggregate reporting only**.
- Grantees may use participant IDs internally for measurement and operations, but must keep identity mapping controlled and minimized.

### 9.3 Retention
- **Raw data:** retain max **12 months after the program ends**, then delete.
- **Aggregated data:** may be retained **indefinitely**.

### 9.4 Consent
Consent is embedded in enrollment, with **explicit opt-out for non-essential measurement**.

---

## 10) Budget policy

### 10.1 Overhead cap
- **Hard cap: 20%** of the grant budget.

### 10.2 Allowable costs (case-by-case posture within scope)
Allowable costs are assessed **case-by-case** (must be well-justified and aligned to delivery/learning), including:
- Program delivery (facilitators, materials, venue)
- Transport/meals/access supports
- Devices/tools and insurance
- Safeguarding and PDPA compliance costs
- External evaluation support (subject to the M&E burden cap)

---

## 11) For-profit involvement (vendor model only)

- Subcontracting to a for-profit is **allowed** only as a **service provider model** (primary grantee must be a charity).
- **Pass-through is not allowed:** a charity cannot be used as a wrapper for mostly for-profit delivery/control.

---

## 12) Publication and transparency

### 12.1 Annual publication minimum
Each active grant must publish learnings at least **once per year** (anonymized as appropriate).

### 12.2 Publication formats
- Ongoing short-form posts **and**
- Annual synthesis (e.g., PDF compendium)

### 12.3 Expanded learning template (required contents)
Each annual write-up must include:
- Hypothesis and theory of change (mechanism)
- Cohort definition, recruitment funnel, and dosage
- Retention/completion and reasons for drop-off
- Outcomes and results (including comparison logic when applicable)
- Unit economics: cost per youth per cycle; cost-down levers and progress
- Safeguarding incidents (if any) and resolution learnings
- Implementation pitfalls and changes made
- Failure analysis (what did not work and why)
- Handoff readiness status and next steps

### 12.4 Exceptions
Publication exceptions are **case-by-case** (e.g., legal/safety risks), with panel recommendation and anchor decision.

---

## 13) Handoff within ~3 years

### 13.1 Lane selection
By **Month 12**, each grant must specify a **handoff lane** (set per grant).

### 13.2 Month 24 “handoff-ready” minimum (light pack)
By Month 24, the grantee should be able to provide a light handoff package:
- Program playbook (what is delivered and how)
- Unit economics summary
- Evidence snapshot (outcomes + implementation learnings)

### 13.3 Fund role
The fund provides **active co-development from Month 12** (help shaping the handoff lane, evidence narrative, and package).

---

## 14) Portfolio strategy and pipeline

- Active grants/year: **3–5**
- Strategy: **thematic cycles**
- Concentration limits: **none**
- Pipeline: **hybrid** (scout + open call)
- Diligence: **standard**
- Renewals vs new bets: **50/50** (portfolio-level target)

### 14.1 Anchor donor discretionary allocation (strictly 20%): joy and happiness learning

The fund sets aside a discretionary allocation that is **strictly capped at 20% of the anchor donor’s annual allocation**. This allocation is dedicated to **joy and happiness learning** for youth.

Co-donor contributions are **not** used for this category by default. A co-donor may opt in or opt out **in flight** through a written election recorded by the charity holding the fund. Opt-in applies **prospectively** to **uncommitted balances and future contributions** only, and does not retroactively reallocate funds already committed to approved grants. The election is a category preference and does not give the co-donor control over specific recipients or grant decisions; the holding charity retains full discretion.

This category remains **youth-focused and Singapore-only**. It is intended for programs where the primary value is **happiness, joy, play, and positive learning experiences**, including shorter-form opportunities that may not fit the fund’s standard experimentation cadence.

All non-negotiables still apply (especially safeguarding, mandatory reporting, and data dignity/PDPA). This category is separate from the overhead cap policy.


#### 14.1.1 What this allocation is for
Examples include joy- and play-oriented enrichment (arts, sports, maker activities, cultural experiences, outdoor experiences) delivered directly to youth, as well as short-cycle pilots and one-off experiences (including holiday camps).

This allocation must not fund mental health crisis response, medication-adjacent work, or clinical treatment.

#### 14.1.2 Evidence and measurement (lightweight but real)
Discretionary grants still report the fund’s minimum indicators where applicable:
- Attendance / dosage
- Safeguarding incidents and resolution timeliness
- Retention / completion (only when the program has multiple sessions where retention is meaningful)

Because joy programs can be short-form, durability requirements may be adapted. Grantees should define a practical durability proxy such as repeat participation, re-enrolment into a follow-on activity, or repeated delivery across at least two runs over the year.

Where appropriate, grantees may add a minimal, privacy-respecting “joy signal” (for example, a short anonymous pulse on enjoyment or willingness to return), without materially increasing measurement burden and without violating data dignity rules.

#### 14.1.3 Documentation and publication
Discretionary grants still require a short learning brief at award. For one-off or short-form activities, a post-activity write-up may replace longer checkpoint reporting. It should cover what was delivered, who was served (aggregate), attendance, any safeguarding issues, and what was learned.

Learnings from discretionary grants should be published at least annually and may be aggregated into a single yearly discretionary portfolio note.

#### 14.1.4 Governance and approvals
Discretionary grants are approved by the **anchor donor**. The grant panel may be consulted, but consultation is not required.

These grants are eligible for the conflict-of-interest handling described in Section 15.3.

#### 14.1.5 Co-donor opt-in/out elections (prospective)
Co-donors may opt in or opt out of allowing their funds to be used for joy and happiness discretionary grants through a written election recorded by the charity holding the fund. Elections take effect from the stated effective date (or the next portfolio cut-off) and apply only to uncommitted balances and future contributions. Elections do not retroactively reallocate funds already committed to approved grants.

## 15) Governance and conflicts of interest

### 15.1 Decision rights
- Anchor donor retains **final grant-approval authority** and renewal/stop/graduation authority.
- Grant panel provides discussion and recommendation.

### 15.2 Conflicts of interest (recusal)

Recusal is required when a decision-maker (anchor donor or grant panel member) has **recent ties (lookback: 12 months)** or a **close personal relationship** with an applicant. Recusal scope is **discussion and vote**.

**Recent ties (12-month lookback)** means any external relationship that could reasonably bias judgment, including:
- Employment, contracting, paid advisory work, or any paid engagement with the applicant (including via the member’s organisation)
- Governance or leadership roles (board, trustee, committee with decision rights, officer roles), even if unpaid
- Financial interests (ownership, revenue share, referral fees, commissions, or any arrangement where the member could benefit if the grant is awarded)
- Material partnerships where the member’s organisation is a key supplier/customer/partner and the grant could affect that relationship
- Immediate family-linked versions of the above

A panel member’s **personal donation** to an applicant within the last 12 months is treated as a recent tie only if it is **material**, defined as **SGD 25,000 or more**, or if the member is publicly positioned as a key sponsor or major donor. Smaller personal donations should be disclosed but do not require recusal.

For avoidance of doubt, prior participation in decisions made **as part of this fund** and the fund’s own prior grants to an applicant (including renewals) do not constitute a conflict of interest.
### 15.3 Conflict-of-interest exception for joy and happiness discretionary grants (with holding charity gate)

For **joy and happiness discretionary grants** (Section 14.1), the fund permits an exception to the recusal policy in Section 15.2. This means conflicts that would normally require recusal do not prevent a joy and happiness discretionary grant from proceeding.

Where co-donor funds are used for this category, they may only be used if the co-donor has opted in via a written election recorded by the charity holding the fund (see Section 14.1.5). Opt-in does not grant the co-donor control over specific recipients or grant decisions.

Even when this exception is used, the charity holding the fund must apply an independent **public good and tax-deductibility gate** before disbursement. At minimum, the holding charity must confirm and document:
- The grant is for charitable public benefit and is delivered directly to youth (aggregate reporting only)
- There is no improper private benefit to the anchor donor, any co-donor, or connected persons, and the arrangement is not sponsorship or commercial in substance
- Safeguarding and data dignity requirements are met for the activity risk level
- The decision rationale is recorded, and the gate is approved by a non-conflicted approver within the holding charity

The holding charity retains the right to veto any discretionary grant that does not pass this gate.

---

## Appendix C: Trajectory Lever Definitions and Default Metrics (Starter Set)

This appendix is a practical starter set to help grantees select a **Primary Outcome (Trajectory Lever)** quickly. Grantees may adapt these to context, but must preserve:
- a **behavioral/admin anchor**, and
- a **durability definition**.

### C1) Sustained engagement / persistence (behavioral/admin)
**Definition:** Continued participation and re-engagement over time in the target activity.  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- Continuity months (months active without dropping out)
- Attendance continuity (e.g., % weeks attended; streaks; gap frequency)
- Practice hours (tracked hours per week/month)
- Re-enrolment rate into next cycle  
**Durability defaults:** sustained >= 8 weeks; and/or repeated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C2) Skill / mastery progression (domain-specific)
**Definition:** Observable progression in a defined skill pathway.  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- Progression level attained (e.g., levels/badges/modules completed)
- Competency rubric score (pre/post on a small rubric)
- Portfolio/output quality progression (scored artifacts over time)
- Task difficulty progression (youth completes increasingly difficult tasks)  
**Behavioral/admin anchors:** level advancement; module completion; artifact completion counts.  
**Durability defaults:** progression sustained across >= 8 weeks; and/or replicated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C3) Self-regulation / executive function (behavioral/rubric)
**Definition:** Improved planning, follow-through, and regulation in the context of program tasks.  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- Planning/follow-through rubric (mentor/facilitator rated)
- Task completion under challenge (completion of “hard tasks” or persistence tasks)
- On-time completion rate for assigned practice/tasks
- Goal-setting and review cycles completed (count of completed cycles)  
**Behavioral/admin anchors:** completion rates; on-time rates; cycle counts.  
**Durability defaults:** sustained >= 8 weeks; and/or repeated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C4) Belonging / social connectedness
**Definition:** Increased sense of belonging and constructive participation in a community.  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- Anonymous belonging/self-reported connectedness (short, age-appropriate scale)
- Participation in group activities (admin counts; contributions/roles taken)
- Peer network engagement (e.g., number of sessions with active collaboration)
- Group contribution rubric (facilitator rated; anchored to observable behaviors)  
**Behavioral/admin anchors:** participation counts; role-taking counts; collaboration session counts.  
**Durability defaults:** sustained >= 8 weeks; and/or repeated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C5) Autonomy / choice competence
**Definition:** Improved ability to make and execute meaningful choices, including adaptation after mismatch.  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- “Quality of choice cycle” rubric (initiate -> articulate reasons -> execute -> reflect/adapt)
- Number of self-initiated choices/actions (admin counts)
- Follow-through rate on chosen plan (completion/attendance for chosen activity)
- Adaptation after mismatch (documented switch with reflection)  
**Behavioral/admin anchors:** follow-through rates; count of initiated choices; completion of choice cycles.  
**Durability defaults:** sustained >= 8 weeks; and/or repeated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C6) Wellbeing / functioning (case-by-case; low priority; non-clinical)
**Definition:** Non-clinical functioning improvements that enable participation (no treatment/clinical services).  
**Default metrics (pick 1–2):**
- Attendance/participation enabled by functioning (admin continuity)
- Simple functioning checklist (non-sensitive; aligned to program context)
- Caregiver/mentor-rated functioning rubric (non-clinical, minimal)  
**Behavioral/admin anchors:** participation continuity; reduction in missed sessions due to functioning-related barriers (if tracked non-sensitively).  
**Durability defaults:** sustained >= 8 weeks; and/or repeated across >= 2 cycles by Month 24.

### C7) Mechanism Indicator examples (for the required Primary Mechanism Indicator)
Mechanism indicators should be the earliest observable proof that the theory of change is firing. Examples:
- Short rubric that scores a key behavior (e.g., “choice cycle quality”, “practice habit formation”, “mentor-youth session quality” with observable anchors)
- Artifact-based early outputs (e.g., first completed project; early portfolio milestones)
- Behavioral proxy that precedes the main outcome (e.g., week-2 re-attendance, first 3-week streak, first level completion)

Mechanism indicators should be:
- lightweight to collect,
- clearly linked to the primary outcome, and
- detectable by Month 6–12.
