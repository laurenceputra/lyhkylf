# Lai Yu Hua Kindness Youth Lit Fund
## Communication Principles Policy (v0.3)

This policy sets the ground rules for how we communicate about the fund. If anything here conflicts with the LYHKYLF Fund Policy, the Fund Policy takes priority.

This policy applies to all external communications and to internal communications that are likely to be shared externally.

---

## 1) Purpose and scope

### Policy
Our communications must consistently do four things:

1. State what the fund is, what it funds, and what it will not do, in a way that is accurate and checkable.
2. Help the right partners find us (youth-serving charities delivering directly to youth) and help the right co-funders understand us (especially institutional handoff stakeholders).
3. Build trust through disciplined transparency: we share what we learn, including what fails, without compromising safeguarding or privacy.
4. Keep our posture consistent: soft in claims, hard in delivery.

### Operational guidance
This policy applies to: website pages, one-pagers, open call briefs, decks, press statements, social posts, annual learning publications, partner updates, and any partner-facing content that could be shared externally.

---

## 2) Identity foundations

### Policy
Our identity is anchored in:

- **Memorial origin:** created in memory of Lai Yu Hua, to continue his spirit of giving.
- **Uplift orientation:** focused on helping low-income youth in Singapore move beyond survival and improve their longer-term trajectory.
- **Disciplined experimentation:** we fund high-learning experiments and make decisions through clear gates and evidence (per Fund Policy).
- **Hard lines:** we do not compromise on safeguarding, data dignity and PDPA, or beneficiary harm.

### Operational guidance
Keep the origin story concise and respectful. Do not over-sentimentalize. The tone should communicate care and seriousness.

---

## 3) Audience-first content protocol

### Policy
Before drafting any external asset, record these four fields:

1. Primary audience and secondary audience
2. Goal and required action (apply, donate, refer, partner, co-fund, handoff interest)
3. Channel and format (one-pager, landing page, deck, post, open call brief)
4. Sensitivity level (how prominently to feature the memorial origin, what names to include, how to talk about failures, youth story boundaries)

No asset should be published without this intake.

### Operational guidance
Use Appendix A as the default pre-brief. If something is time-sensitive, the intake can be answered inline in a message thread, but it still needs all four fields.

---

## 4) Positioning and differentiation

### Policy
We differentiate through "high learning, bounded risk":

- We accept failure in recruitment, delivery models, mechanisms, and outcomes as part of experimentation.
- We do not accept safeguarding breaches, PDPA or data dignity lapses, or harm to beneficiaries.
- We exist to turn validated learning into institutional adoption pathways within about three years, with clear handoff expectations (per Fund Policy).

We must never describe this as "less accountability." We are accountable to learning and to safety.

### Operational guidance
Use this as the default backbone line (adjust wording to fit the audience, do not change the meaning):

> We take risk on ideas, not on children’s safety or privacy. We fund bold experiments, measure early, publish what we learn (including failures), and build handoff-ready models that institutions can adopt.

---

## 5) Themes and approved framing

### Policy
Our current thematic cycles are:

1. **Enrichment models:** school-adjacent enrichment that builds agency and capabilities.
2. **Learning uplift:** learning progression and capability development. Exam results may be tracked only as a secondary external signal when feasible.

Communications must not position "exam scores" as the fund’s primary definition of success. Primary outcomes must be framed using the Fund Policy trajectory levers and evidence gates.

### Operational guidance
Preferred public phrasing includes:
- learning progression, mastery progression
- study habits, self-regulation
- sustained engagement, persistence
- capability uplift

Avoid leading with:
- we raise grades
- we boost PSLE or O-level scores
- we guarantee results

---

## 6) Claims policy and evidence ladder

### Policy
Every claim must be true, bounded, and supported by evidence we actually have today. If something is intent, label it as intent.

We use an evidence ladder aligned to the Fund Policy gates:

- **Pre-evidence (default):** we test, we learn, we publish, we build the conditions for adoption.
- **After Month 6:** we may state that outcomes and measurement are locked, and that early mechanism movement is observed, only if true.
- **After Month 12:** we may state that we see benefit signals and plausible linkage from mechanism to outcome, only if true.
- **After Month 24:** we may state durability or repeatability and a handoff-ready package, only if true.

### Operational guidance
Maintain a simple claim bank with:
- the claim text
- where the evidence lives (memo or publication)
- date last verified
- a public-safe version and an institutional version

Appendix B is the default format.

---

## 7) Transparency, open learning, and licensing

### Policy
We are public by default and open learning by default.

1. We publish learnings at least annually per the Fund Policy, including failures, unless a safety or legal exception applies.
2. We publish reusable artifacts by default in a public repository (templates, rubrics, playbooks, measurement instruments, implementation checklists, and non-sensitive code).
3. We use permissive reuse licensing by default, unless an exception is needed for safety or legal reasons.

### Operational guidance
Use the principle: open learning, not open data. We publish insights and tools, not identifiable participant data or sensitive operational details that increase risk.

Repository minimum:
- README that explains what it is and how to reuse it
- LICENSE file (default permissive)
- a short note on redactions (what was removed and why)
- versioning by cohort or cycle, when relevant

---

## 8) Partner, program, and vendor attribution

### Policy
- We are public by default and may name partner organizations by default.
- We do not publish vendor identities.
- Any partner may request anonymity, and we honor that.
- Youth identities are not published. Default is anonymization. Any exception requires explicit consent and a safeguarding review.

### Operational guidance
Give credit clearly and factually. For the existing proof point, use wording like:

- One program transitioned beyond our funding into ComLink. Credit to 3pumpkins for execution and the network-enabled transition. Our role was funding the right group and project.

Avoid language that implies endorsement by a government entity.

---

## 9) Institutional orientation and non-advocacy boundary

### Policy
We may state our institutional handoff ambition (for example, MOE as a target adopter by Year 3). We do not position the fund as a policy advocacy organization.

Our role is to fund experiments, generate publishable learning, and package handoff-ready models. Others may use the evidence in policy processes. We do not lobby.

### Operational guidance
Allowed phrasing:
- designed for institutional adoption
- handoff-ready packages
- evidence that can inform decision-makers

Avoid phrasing such as:
- we will push legislation
- we campaign
- we advocate for policy change

When mentioning parliamentary proposals (for example, Curiosity Credits), keep it factual: we aim to generate credible evidence and implementation lessons that decision-makers may consider.

---

## 10) Safeguarding and data dignity in communications

### Policy
Any asset that references experimentation or risk tolerance must also state our non-negotiables:

- safeguarding is mandatory and uncompromising
- data dignity and PDPA posture is minimal collection and aggregate reporting
- no harm to beneficiaries

### Operational guidance
Use this standard footer in risk-themed assets:

> Non-negotiables: safeguarding and mandatory reporting, minimal data collection, aggregate reporting, and no harm to beneficiaries.

Do not publish operationally sensitive details (for example, incident specifics). Use the Fund Policy publication exception pathway if disclosure increases risk.

---

## 11) Risk posture triggers we will stand behind (Option 2)

### Policy
We commit to a simple traffic-light posture:

- **Green:** program hypotheses may fail. We continue when safeguarding and data posture are intact and learning is clear.
- **Amber:** we pause affected activities when safeguarding or data concerns arise, or when controls fail. We restart only after corrective action.
- **Red:** we stop when serious harm or misconduct occurs, when a material PDPA or data dignity breach occurs without effective remediation, or when high-risk safeguarding incidents remain unresolved beyond the Fund Policy threshold.

### Operational guidance
In public materials, describe the posture at the principle level. Keep detailed timelines, triage steps, and internal thresholds in internal documents unless needed for institutional diligence.

---

## 12) Voice, tone, and language rules

### Policy
Our voice is:
- inspirational and optimistic in intent
- realistic and specific in claims
- firm and precise in standards and delivery expectations

Singlish is allowed selectively for public reach. It is not used in institutional documents, agreements, safeguarding materials, data materials, or anything where ambiguity creates risk.

### Operational guidance
A practical rule:
- Public social: Singlish-lite is acceptable when it increases accessibility without weakening meaning.
- Institutional and formal documents: standard professional English only.

---

## 13) Governance and approvals

### Policy
- Any asset that makes outcome claims, names institutional targets, discusses incidents, or references partners must be reviewed against this policy and the Fund Policy before publication.
- Every asset must have a named owner responsible for factual accuracy and policy compliance.

### Operational guidance
Keep approvals lightweight:
1. Creator drafts and attaches the Content Intake.
2. Reviewer checks against this policy and the Fund Policy.
3. The designated fund decision owner approves final publication.
