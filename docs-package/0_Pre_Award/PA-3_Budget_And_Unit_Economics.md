## 1) Budget table (SGD)
| Line item | Amount | Notes | Fixed/Variable |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Program delivery staff |  |  |  |
| Facilitators/coaches |  |  |  |
| Venue/materials |  |  |  |
| Transport/meals/access supports |  |  |  |
| Safeguarding & compliance |  |  |  |
| Measurement / evaluation |  |  |  |
| Vendor/service providers (if any) |  |  |  |
| Other |  |  |  |
| **Overhead (≤20%)** |  |  |  |
| **Total request** |  |  |  |

### Overhead statement (required)
- Overhead % of total: [ ]% (must be ≤20%)
- What overhead covers (2–4 bullets):
  - [ ]
  - [ ]

---

## 2) Unit economics (required)
- **Cohort size:** [ ]
- **Cycle length (weeks/months):** [ ]
- **Total cost per cycle:** [ ]
- **Cost per youth per cycle:** [ ] = Total cost ÷ Cohort size
- **Variable cost per youth (estimate):** [ ]
- **Fixed cost per cycle (estimate):** [ ]

### Cost curve hypothesis (required)
- What must change for unit cost to reduce materially? (pick 1–2 and explain)
  - [ ] Increase cohort size without proportional staffing
  - [ ] Standardize / automate admin or verification
  - [ ] Lower materials/venue costs
  - [ ] Vendor discounts / procurement efficiencies
  - [ ] Other: [ ]

---

## 3) Vendor/service providers (if any)
- **Are for-profit vendors involved?** [Yes/No]
- **% total spend paid to vendors:** [ ]%
- **Why this is not pass-through (charity’s unique control/value-add):**
  - Eligibility + cohort control: [ ]
  - Program rules / pedagogy / coaching: [ ]
  - QA / safeguarding oversight: [ ]
  - Verification / reconciliation: [ ]

---

## 4) Measurement budget & burden (required)
- **Measurement spend (SGD):** [ ]
- **Estimated measurement burden (%):** [ ]% (target ≤ ~20%)
- If >20%, provide justification and what is being reduced elsewhere: [ ]
