# PA-6 — Draft Award Learning Brief (One-Pager)

**Fund:** LYHKYLF • **Phase:** Pre-award • **Version:** v0.3 + Anchored Open-Set Lever

**Target length:** 1 page.  
**Purpose:** Pre-fill what will become the award learning brief to reduce rework and lock hypotheses early.

---

## 1) Problem and target cohort
- **Problem statement (1–2 sentences):** [ ]
- **Target cohort:** ages [ ], locations [ ], low-income method [ ]
- **Cohort size per cycle:** [ ]

---

## 2) Theory of Change (mechanism)
- **Mechanism (what changes in the youth, and why):** [ ]
- **Key assumption to test first:** [ ]

---

## 3) Delivery plan and dosage
- **Program activities (bullets):**
  - [ ]
  - [ ]
- **Session definition:** [ ]
- **Expected sessions per youth per year (≥15):** [ ]

---

## 4) Outcomes (anchored open set)
- **Primary Outcome (Trajectory Lever):** (attach PA-5)  
  - Lever name: [ ]
  - Behavioral/admin anchor: [ ]
  - Durability definition: [ ]

- **Primary Mechanism Indicator (proximal):**
  - Indicator: [ ]
  - Why it should move by Month 6: [ ]

---

## 5) Hypotheses (mandatory)
### Mechanism hypothesis
- If we deliver X, we expect Y to change in the child because Z.  
  [ ]

### Adoption hypothesis
- Recruitment/retention will work because…; main reasons for drop-off will be…  
  [ ]

### Cost curve hypothesis
- Unit cost per youth per cycle is [ ]; it will drop if we change [ ].  
  [ ]

### Safeguarding hypothesis
- Primary risks are [ ]; mitigations are [ ]; incidents should resolve within [ ].  
  [ ]

---

## 6) Measurement plan (≤ ~20% burden)
- **Instruments used (≤3 preferred):** [ ]
- **Cadence:** [ ]
- **Data dignity:** aggregate reporting; minimal identifiers; delete raw data ≤12 months post-program

---

## 7) Month 6 provisional targets (revise once at Month 6; then lock)
- **Recruitment/adoption target:** [ ]
- **Dosage/attendance target:** [ ]
- **Retention/completion target:** [ ]
- **Mechanism signal target:** [ ]
- **Safeguarding target:** [ ]

---

## 8) Risks and mitigations
- Top 3 risks + mitigations:
  1) [ ] → [ ]
  2) [ ] → [ ]
  3) [ ] → [ ]
