# PA-5 — Trajectory Lever Definition Sheet (Anchored Open Set)

**Fund:** LYHKYLF • **Phase:** Pre-award • **Version:** v0.3 + Anchored Open-Set Lever

**Target length:** 1 page.  
**Purpose:** Allow default or custom levers while preserving comparability and rigor via anchors + durability.

---

## 1) Lever type (choose one)
- [ ] **Default menu lever** (select one)
  - [ ] Sustained engagement / persistence
  - [ ] Skill / mastery progression
  - [ ] Self-regulation / executive function
  - [ ] Belonging / social connectedness
  - [ ] Autonomy / choice competence
  - [ ] Wellbeing / functioning (non-clinical; case-by-case)
- [ ] **Custom lever (open set)**

---

## 2) Standard lever definition schema (required for BOTH default and custom)
- **Lever name:** [ ]
- **What changes in the youth (plain language):** [ ]
- **Behavioral/admin anchor (required):**  
  (Must be observable behavior, artifact, or admin record — not self-report-only)  
  [ ]

- **Durability definition (required):**  
  Define what “durable” means (e.g., ≥8 weeks sustained, repeated across cycles/cohorts).  
  [ ]

- **Unit of analysis:** [Youth-level internally / Group-level / Other]
- **Measurement cadence:** [weekly / monthly / per cycle]
- **Who measures:** [ ]

---

## 3) Metrics (pick 1–2 primary metrics)
### Metric 1
- **Name:** [ ]
- **Definition:** [ ]
- **How computed (numerator/denominator or rubric anchors):** [ ]
- **Data source:** [ ]

### Metric 2 (optional)
- **Name:** [ ]
- **Definition:** [ ]
- **How computed:** [ ]
- **Data source:** [ ]

---

## 4) Primary Mechanism Indicator (proximal; required)
- **Indicator name:** [ ]
- **Why it should move by Month 6:** [ ]
- **Instrument / data source:** [ ]
- **Cadence:** [ ]

---

## 5) Anchor Test (must pass all for custom levers)
- [ ] Observable behavioral/admin anchor exists (not self-report-only)
- [ ] Durability definition is explicit
- [ ] Feasible within ≤ ~20% measurement burden
- [ ] Aggregate reporting is possible (no raw identifiers shared to fund)

---

## 6) Canonical domain mapping (for portfolio analysis)
Pick one primary domain so the fund can aggregate across diverse levers:
- [ ] Agency
- [ ] Learning / Skill
- [ ] Health / Functioning
- [ ] Creativity / Production
- [ ] Social / Relational
- [ ] Economic / Transition readiness
- [ ] Other (justify): [ ]

---

## 7) Month-6 signal (provisional; will be locked at Month 6)
- What movement do you expect by Month 6, and in whom?  
  [ ]

- What would count as “no signal / falsification”?  
  [ ]
